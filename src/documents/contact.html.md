If you want or need to contact me you can easily do so by sending an email to my email account <eduan@snapsimpletech.com>.

If you want to request me as a freelancer please include "Freelancer: " at the start of the message title. Also please include the following info in your email:

- Your first and last names.
- The email to which I should send the answer to.
- Your budget, i.e. how much you *can* pay me for this job.
- The description of what you want/need.

I also take requests for making you an entire website using [DocPad](https://docpad.org). This does not include design, you need to design the website and have it on paper, my job is to put your already drawn and 100% finished vision into DocPad terms. If you want to request help from me for this go ahead and include that in the description of what you need from me.

Now, the only requirement I have in order for you to hire me is that you aren't a [Client From Hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/) (no offense).

<!--
Lastly, if you just want to say thanks you can just send me an email saying so, although you can also do so using [Flattr](https://flattr.com/howflattrworks) or [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/about/):

<script id='flattrbtn'>(function(i){var f,s=document.getElementById(i);f=document.createElement('iframe');f.src='//api.flattr.com/button/view/?uid=Greduan&button=compact&url='+encodeURIComponent(document.URL);f.title='Flattr';f.height=20;f.width=110;f.style.borderWidth=0;s.parentNode.insertBefore(f,s);})('flattrbtn');</script>

<iframe style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;"
		src="https://www.gittip.com/Greduan/widget.html"
		width="48pt" height="22pt"></iframe>
-->

Oh, BTW, for freelancer work I accept payments in PayPal only (for now).
