If you want or need to contact me you can easily do so by sending an email to my email account <eduanlavaque@gmail.com>.

If you want to request me as a freelancer please include "Freelancer: " at the start of the message title. Also please include the following info in your email:

- Your first and last names.
- The email to which I should send the answer to.
- Your budget, i.e. how much you *can* pay me for this job.
- The description of what you want/need.

**Before you contact me for help with s2Member, please post it in the [s2Member forums](http://www.s2member.com/forums/) first, wait a week or so, and then contact me. :)**

Now, the only requirement I have in order for you to hire me as a freelancer is that you aren't a [Client From Hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/) (no offense). So keep that in mind.

Lastly, if you just want to say thanks you can just send me an email saying so, although you can also do so using [Flattr](https://flattr.com/howflattrworks) or [Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/about/):

<script id='flattrbtn'>(function(i){var f,s=document.getElementById(i);f=document.createElement('iframe');f.src='//api.flattr.com/button/view/?uid=Greduan&button=compact&url='+encodeURIComponent(document.URL);f.title='Flattr';f.height=20;f.width=110;f.style.borderWidth=0;s.parentNode.insertBefore(f,s);})('flattrbtn');</script>

<iframe style="border: 0; margin: 0; padding: 0;"
