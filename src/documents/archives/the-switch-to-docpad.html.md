I did it! I re-designed my website! w00t! Oh that was one hell of a challenge. It's the first time I don't have a theme do all the CSS and JS for me.

So why did I re-design? Well first, I needed a look different than the default WordPress theme, and WordPress themes are so damn complicated for me. So that's one reason. Second, I don't like WordPress. It's good for blogs and all, but I don't like it, too bloated and slow and (IMO) badly coded.

So the solution? In the end it was [DocPad](http://docpad.org), which in my opinion is currently the best way for developers/coders/programmers to make their websites.

How did I come to this decision? Well, I learned about DocPad a long time ago actually, around 1 month ago (that's when I starred the GitHub repo, pretty sure I knew about it around half a year ago). I became aware of static website generators thanks to [MacDrifter](http://macdrifter.com/) (which BTW is a great blog to follow), when he talked about [re-designing his website](http://www.macdrifter.com/2013/03/my-redesign-for-speed-and-legibility.html) and stuff, he mentioned static websites. He's using [Pelican 3](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/), which I personally don't like, seemed too complicated, or rather not too clear, so I kept searching around.

After searching around a bit, I came across DocPad, a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based static website generator. At the time I thought it wasn't that interesting, since I wasn't really interested in making a website's CSS all by my own. Instead I found [Statamic](http://statamic.com/), which is a great static website generator to be honest. I was excited with their videos and their docs and I bought a personal license (after consulting with support about which license would be better). I gotta admit Statamic also requires you to do your CSS yourself, but it was *clearer* on how to do stuff so I liked it more.

I started developing my website in Statamic, just as planned, but my mind soon started shifting towards DocPad again. I felt they were too similar somehow, and I felt like DocPad was more robust in a way. I decided to give it another chance, I watched Benjamin's introductory video [Rapid Web Development with DocPad](http://youtu.be/hvQCXDWh7Wg), him being the lead dev I thought it was a good idea. Mind you, I did know how DocPad worked before, sorta, however I still wasn't *used* to using Unix/Linux, something which you gotta be familiar with if you're using DocPad, now I am. So when I watched it again I fell in love with it.

Now I gotta admit, I'm a little promiscuous with my software, but DocPad is definitely a keeper.

Later on this year (say year just to not promise any date) I'll make another post with my exact setup, my CSS styles, the JS I'm using. All the stuff you would need to know to make a website like mine. But for now be happy with my [GitHub repo with my DocPad files](https://github.com/Greduan/docpad-eduantech.com).

So, to recap:

- I switched to Statamic (didn't finish website), then to Docpad, at which I'm currently at.
- Watch the [Rapid Web Development with DocPad](http://youtu.be/hvQCXDWh7Wg) video if you're a developer, at least to understand what DocPad is and how it works.
- Later this year I'll post all the info you need to make a website like mine is done, but for now you have my [GitHub repo with my DocPad files](https://github.com/Greduan/eduantech.docpad).
