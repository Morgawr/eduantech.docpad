Hi, my name is Eduardo Lavaque (please call me Eduan) and I am a hobby freelancer and I specialize in clean designs and code that is easy to read and makes sense to use (as long as you know the code of course). I've been coding since around 4 years ago, so I know my way around in a sense.

I am a blogger, entrepreneur, designer, web developer, moderator for the s2Member forums and overall thinker.

Now that the formal introduction is done, let's talk a little more personal.

I love open source, in fact I like contributing to open source software (when I can). I'm always on the lookout for new exciting stuff that's useful.

I am a gamer when I can. If you want you can buy me a game on Steam. ;) Here's a link to my [wishlist](http://steamcommunity.com/id/greduan/wishlist), buy whatever you want there, no real need to check what it is, I want it anyway. :)

Now that that is done, let's check some info about my website:

- It was built using DocPad, the Node.js based static website generator (yes this website is static).
- It is being hosted by my good friend [Daniel Voogsgerd](https://github.com/DanielVoogsgerd) and his company [RealiseWeb](http://realiseweb.nl). Instead of giving you a server that works with everything, he provides you with a server that works for *you*.
- It makes use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) (duh) and [Modernizr.js](http://modernizr.com/) as well.
- The title font is the [Merriweather](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Merriweather) font, the content font is the [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) font. Both beautiful fonts that go along well.

I don't think I missed anything important... If you want to contact me please go to my [Contact Me](/contact.html) page.
