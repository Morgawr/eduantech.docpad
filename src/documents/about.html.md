Hi, my name is Eduardo LÃ¡vaque (please call me Eduan) and I am a hobby freelancer and I specialize in clean designs and code. I've been coding since around 2009 or so, so I sorta know my way around, I'm not much compared to the experts though.

I am a blogger, entrepreneur, designer, web developer, moderator for the s2Member forums and overall thinker).

I love open source, in fact I like contributing to open source software (when I can). I'm always on the lookout for new exciting stuff that's useful.

I am a gamer when I can. I'm on Steam and on Desura and other places that don't matter much.

Now let's check some info about my website:

- It was built using DocPad, the Node.js based static website generator.
- It is being hosted by my good friend, [Daniel Voogsgerd](https://github.com/DanielVoogsgerd) and his company [RealiseWeb](http://realiseweb.nl). Instead of giving you a server that works with everything, he provides you with a server that works for *you* and *your* needs.

I don't think I missed anything important... If you want to contact me please go to my [Contact Me](/contact.html) page.
