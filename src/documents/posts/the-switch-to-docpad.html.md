Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.

I switched to [DocPad][1], the [Node.js][2] based static website generator. It's a static website generator but if you wish it can be completely dynamic.

I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using [CoffeeKup][3] and [Eco][4] as templating languages and [CoffeeScript][5] for the JavaScript logic.
