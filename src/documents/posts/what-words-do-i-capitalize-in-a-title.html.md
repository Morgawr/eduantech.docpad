I often asked myself this question when writing blog posts. I usually just went with the only capitalize if first word of title, first word after dot or colon and names.

That seemed to work out OK. I didn't find any problems with it and I don't find it grammatically incorrect, but this time it's different. This time I want stuff to look nice. So we're gonna capitalize the correct words of our titles.

So what's the problem with that? Well... It's not as simple as just capitalizing every word of our title.

The title we're gonna be working with in this example is "This is an extra long title so I can see what happens if the title is long".

As you can see it's all lowercase except the first word of the title. That's the style I used before, today we're gonna learn a more correct style (for titles).

First let's look at the rules there are for this, the following rules tell you which words *should* have a title case:

- The *first* or *last* word in the title.
- Articles. This means "the", "a", "an" and sometimes "some".
- Prepositions. Of *four or fewer letters*.
- Conjuctions. Of *four or fewer letters*.
- The particle "to" used with an infinitive[ˆparticleto].

[ˆparticleto]: For an example of the infinitive particle "to" capitalized at the end of the title, take this title as an example "It's My Participle, and I'll Dangle It if I Want To".
