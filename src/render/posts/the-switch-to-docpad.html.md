Well I finally switched to something else than WordPress.

I switched to [DocPad][1], the [Node.js][2] based static website generator.
It's a static website generator but if you wish it can be completely dynamic.

I am using Markdown to write my posts. Using [CoffeeKup][3] and [Eco][4] as
templating languages and [CoffeeScript][5] for the JavaScript logic. And I am
using [SCSS][6] for the CSS, of course.

Also, now my website is being hosted by GitHub Pages, so that's cool.

That is all. Hope you like the changes. :)
