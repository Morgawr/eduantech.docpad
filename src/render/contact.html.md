If you want or need to contact me you can easily do so by sending an email to my email account <eduanlavaque@gmail.com>.

If you want to request me as a freelancer please include "Freelancer: " at the start of the message title. Also please include the following info in your email:

- Your first and last names.
- The email to which I should send the answer to.
- Your budget, i.e. how much you *can* pay me for this job.
- The description of what you want/need.

Now, the only requirement I have in order for you to hire me as a freelancer is that you aren't a [Client From Hell](http://clientsfromhell.net/) (no offense). So keep that in mind.
