## Bug Reports

If you find some behavior that you think might be a bug, please submit a [new issue](https://github.com/Greduan/docpad-eduantech.com/issues/new) so that I can look into what might be the problem.

Please provide as much info as possible, the browser you're using along with the version, the OS (Operating System) that you're using and steps to reproduce.

If you're not sure if it's a bug, please describe what you expected to happen and what actually happened, that way I can see if it's a bug or not. :wink:

If your bug report is valid I will try to reproduce, if I am able to reproduce it I will look into fixing it and reply to your issue once it's fixed.

## Pull Requests

If you are a developer and think that something could be achieved in a better way, like the CSS styles (which are coded with [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/)), the HTML structure or the JavaScript. You know, if there's something to improve go ahead and fork the project.

However before doing a pull request make sure that you didn't break anything, and most importantly CHECK THE WEBSITE WORKS CORRECTLY.

For this of course you need to know how to use DocPad. Good luck!

Oh, one more thing, make your changes in a new Git branch, name it `patch-#` (replacing #) with the number of your pull request. If you're the second person to do a pull request then you would name the new branch `patch-2`. If you later do another pull reuqest and nobody else has done it then the branch would be called `patch-3`.
